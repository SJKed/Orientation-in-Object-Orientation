# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Is a programming model with the goal of organizing code into objects, in an effort to streamline and simplify development and maintance. Its organization giving way for better methods of collaborative work.  

## Structure
The structure of object oriented programs are as follows:
* Classes - Which are the blueprints for objects.
* Objects - Which are the instances of the classes.
* Methods - Which are the functions that are part of the objects.
* Attributes - Which represent the data that is stored within the objects. 

## Principles
The principles of OOP are an effort to increase reusability of code, make it easier to maintain, and to be efficient in the both development and deployment.
* Encapsulation - The idea of encapsulation is to hide the implementation details of an object from the user. So that only select information may be exposed to the user.
* Abstraction - The idea of abstraction is to hide the implementation details of an object from the user. So that only select information may be exposed to the user.
* Inheritance - The idea of inheritance is to reuse the code of a parent class in a child class.
* Polymorphism - The idea of polymorphism is to allow a class to have multiple forms.
